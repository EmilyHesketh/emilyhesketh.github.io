      <description>My name is Emily Hesketh, I am also known as Milly. I will be graduating in 2018 with a degree in BA (Hons) Interior Design from Birmingham City University. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time study at university, and during the three years I have worked on numerous projects, across different design sectors, including live projects. A variety of my work can be found on this website, showing a range of design communication skills I have acquired.</description>
